# Acey - A React State Manager.

#### Acey is Model oriented state manager for React apps.

It enables an organized and scalable architecture thanks to the centralization of the data and their utilities (getter, setter, formatter) inside **Models** (objects) and **Collections** (list of Models). **One time**, **One place**. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Acey helps you to keep your code **organized**, **maintainable**, and easy to **scale**. üå±

<br />

## Get started

### Installation

```
yarn add acey
```


To start the Acey engine **you need to declare the configuration as done** at the **root** of your application.
Here's how according to your environment: 


## On ReactJS
```js
import { config } from 'acey' //HERE
config.done() //HERE

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

<br />

## On React-Native

React-native is not using the same local store engine as web does, so you need to set it up manually at the root of your application:
```js
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-community/async-storage'
import { config } from 'acey'

config.setStoreEngine(AsyncStorage)
config.done()
```
*make sure you already installed and linked async-storage.*
```
yarn add @react-native-community/async-storage
```

<br />

## On NextJS

Refer to the documentation The NextJS Acey's wrapper.

  }

}

//Instance the Counter Model
const Counter = new CounterModel( {counter: 0} , {connected: true})


export default App;

#### prototype: `class Model` üåø

A Model is a class built with an **object of data**. 
It allows you to create all the methods you need related to a specific type of data like **utils**, **getters**, and **setters**.

You build a Model from an Object and options.

`super(data: Object, options: IOptions)`

#### Example of a Model:
```js
import { Model } from 'acey'

// A Model must always have a default state.
const DEFAULT_STATE = {
    id: 0,
    content: ''
}

class Todo extends Model {

    constructor(initialState = DEFAULT_STATE, options){
        super(initialState, options)
    }
    
    content = () => this.state.content
    ID = () => this.state.id
}

export default Todo
```

<br />

- **Model's values**:

    | Name | Type | Description |
    | -- | -- | -- |
    | state |`Object` | return the current Model's data state |
    | options | `Object` | return the Model's options |
    | __childOptions | `Object` | return the connected methods of the current Model (as options). You can then pass this object as options for any instanced Model/Collection inside a connected Model, to make them connected as well without separating each other. |

<br />

- **Model's methods**: 

    | Prototype | Return value | Description |
    | -- | -- | -- |
    | setState(array: Array) |`IAction` | update the state by assigning the current state with the array parameter. |
    | hydrate(state: Array) | `IAction` | fill the Model's state with the JS array `state` passed in parameter. |
    | toPlain() | `Object` | return the state to a plain javascript object. |
    | isCollection() | boolean | return true if the Model is a Collection. |
    | defaultState() | Object | return the state of data of the instanciation. |
    | fetchCookies() | Object |  **(Only if `connected` option is set to `true` and `key` option is `manually set` with `an unique string`)** return the cookies stored by the Model. |
    | clearCookies() | any |  **(Only if `connected` option is set to `true` and `key` option is `manually set` with `an unique string`)** remove the cookies stored by the Model. |
    
<br />

- **IOption (or Model's options)**: 

    | Name | Type | Default | Description |
    | -- | -- | -- | -- |
    | key | `string` | "" | Model's unique key, if `not set` Acey will set it automatically for you. |
    | connected | `bool` | false | If set to `true` the Model is connected to the Acey Store, it will also re-render your component connected with it on changes. |
    
<br />

- **IAction (or Model's actions)**:

    | Prototype | Return value | Description |
    | -- | -- | -- |
    | save() |`IAction` | **(Only if `connected` option is set to `true`)**. Give the order to refresh the store with the new data when the function is called. It will then re-render all the components connected with the Model. |
    | cookie(expires = 365) | `IAction` | **(Only if `connected` option is set to `true` and `key` option is `manually set` with `an unique string`)**. Transform the current data of the model to JSON and store it in the cookies. |

<br />

## Collection

  </a>
</p>

#### prototype: `class Collection extends Model` üå≥

#### A Collection is a Model that has for state an array of Models. (Example: a Todolist is a Collection of Todo Models.)

You build a Collection with :
1. An array of Models or Objects.
2. A non-instanced Model class that represents the Model of the elements in the array.
3. Options

#### Example of a Collection:
```js
import { Collection } from 'acey'
import Todo from './todo'

class Todolist extends Collection {

    constructor(initialState = [], options){
        super(initialState, Todo, options)
    }
    
    //method example
    sortByID = () => {
        /*
            - orderBy sort the list by data and return an array
            of model.
            - We return a fresh instance of a collection with the array
            returned by orderBy
            - __childOptions passes the connected method of the current Collection to the
            the new instanced one. This way if any data is updated in the fresh instance,
            it will be in the state of the current Collection.
        */
        return new TodoCollection( this.orderBy(['id'], ['desc]), this.__childOptions)
    }
}

export default Todolist
```

<br />

- **Collection's values**:

    | Name | Type | Description |
    | -- | -- | -- |
    | state |`Object` | return the current Collection's data state |
    | options | `Object` | return the Collection's options |
    | __childOptions | `Object` | return the connected methods of the current Collection (as options). You can then pass this object as options for any instanced Model inside a connected Collection, to make them connected as well without separating each other. |

<br />

- **Collection's methods**: 

    | Prototype | Return value | Description |
    | -- | -- | -- |
    | count() |`number` | Return the length of the Collection |
    | toListClass(elem: any[]) |`Model[]` | Transform an object array into an instanced Model array |
    | push(v: Object | Model) | `IAction` | Add an element in the array |
    | update(v: Object | Model, index: number) | `IAction` | Update the element at index with the Model passed in parameter |
    | pop() | `IAction` | Remove the last element |
    | shift() | `IAction` | Remove the first element |
    | map(callback: (v: Model, index: number) => any) | `any` | creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element (same than javascript map on arrays) |
    | reduce(callback: (accumulator: any, currentValue: any) => any, initialAccumulator: any) | `any` | Reduces Collection to a value which is the accumulated result of running each element in collection, where each successive invocation is supplied the return value of the previous. If initialAccumulator is not given, the first Model of Collection is used as the initial value. |
    | orderBy(iteratees: any[], orders: any[]) | `Model[]` | Return a sorted array of instanced Model upon the parameters passed |
    | filter(predicate: any) | `Model[]` | Pick up a list of node matching the predicate |
    | find(predicate: any) | `Model | undefined` | Find the first node matching the predicate |
    | findIndex(predicate: any) | `number` | Return the index of the first node matching the predicate |
    | deleteAll(predicate: any) | `IAction` | Delete all the nodes matching the predicate |
    | delete(v: Object | Model) | `IAction` | Delete the model passed in parameter if in the list. |
    | deleteIndex(index: number) | `IAction` | Remove an element at index.
    | indexOf(v: Object | Model) | `number` | Get the index of a node in the list.
    | nodeAt(index: number) | `Model` | Get the node at index in the list, undefined it not found. |
    | newNode(v: Object) | `Model` | Return fresh instanced Model with the value sent in parameter | 
    | hydrate(state: Object) | `IAction` | fill the Model's state with the JS object `state` passed in parameter. |
    | toPlain() | `Object` | return the state of model as a plain javascript array. |
    | isCollection() | boolean | return true if the Model is a Collection. |
    | defaultState() | Object | return the state of data of the instanciation. |
    | fetchCookies() | Object |  **(Only if `connected` option is set to `true` and `key` option is `manually set` with `an unique string`)** return the cookies stored by the Collection. |
    | clearCookies() | any |  **(Only if `connected` option is set to `true` and `key` option is `manually set` with `an unique string`)** remove the cookies stored by the Collection. |
    
<br />

- **IOption (or Collection's options)**: 

    | Name | Type | Default | Description |
    | -- | -- | -- | -- |
    | key | `string` | "" | Model's unique key, if `not set` Acey will set it automatically for you. |
    | connected | `bool` | false | If set to `true` the Collection is connected to the Acey Store, it will also re-render your component connected with it on changes. |
    
<br />

    | Prototype | Return value | Description |
    | -- | -- | -- |
    | save() |`IAction` | **(Only if `connected` option is set to `true`)**. Give the order to refresh the store with the new data when the function is called. It will then re-render all the components connected with the Collection. |

#### All the example are in Typescript, does the library works with Javascript?
Yes, it does! The library is written in Typescript, but you can use Acey if you are writing a React app in JS.
