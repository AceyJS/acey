### Improve your store mangement experience building medium and large React apps.
Ascey is a new way to handle the store you could currently manage with Redux, Mobx and others on your React apps.
It is built on top of Redux, still using some of its logic and features like connect, but is very different in its architecture.
Ascey is based on the MVC system.
